# Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of several Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques in Octave.

## Implementation
PSO helps to find solutions for a wide range of problems and works without traditional optimization methods such as gradient descent/ascent.
In order two show the effectiveness of PSO, we decided to create two different scenarios. The first is a classic minimization/maximization problem, while the second scenario is a more complex one, specifically tailored for PSO.
